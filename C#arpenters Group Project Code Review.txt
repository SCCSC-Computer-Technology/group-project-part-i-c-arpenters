I like how Brandon Hines, Caleb Thompson, and Kara Crumpton login
is very digital-sport decorated theme. Additionally, how Kara made the designs of each background for 
each sport different from lacrosse to playing hang man to make it more entertaining. Each of the data for
different sports are oganized and well sorted of going to website (Wiki) to wanting more info, if the user chooses.

Within the code is even more organized from comments and how each form is structured, if button was clicked on for certain
form. The comments within the code is there along with their team name and the members who are on the team. I also, espically like
how within the comments, within the Sports.cs form, that the sound effects they used is from YouTube to give credit and to make it 
more a demo-type, realistic app or website that the user uses whether it's on a daily or not.

Overall, their work ethic and collab has greatly shown within their presentation on the 12th and within the code review. You guys
have worked tremendously well together and can't wait for future ideas you guys will have on the second group project.
Fantastic work! :)
