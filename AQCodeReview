C-arpenters group project 1 code Review:
members kara, Caleb, and Brandon


first off love the addition of hangman

the fact that it autofills the password and username right after you make the account is also a nice touch

the pictures on the forms are great

the wiki opening in browser is a nice touch 

the ability for users to add and delete rows may either be a good or bad thing depends on if it updates the database or not could cause loss of data

the code is nice but the amount of property setting commands kind of clutters it a bit but not much

i really like how each form updates based on the sport rather than having multiple forms for each  

over all very nice and functional
