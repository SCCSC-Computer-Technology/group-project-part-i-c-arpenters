At first impression, I am a fan of the color scheme of the login page. The login functionality also works exactly as expected. Heading into the main Sports form, the design looks nice - I love how the entire color scheme changes based on which sport is selected! Peeking into the code of this form, it's well-commented and much of the main logic has been placed into separate methods (like the Set___Theme methods) which is always great for organization and readibility. The only thing I might suggest would be to add a StatsClicked() method instead of having all of the logic in places like statsBtn_Click() or saveBtn_Click(). Not a big deal here at all, but it might be useful if ever part of bigger projects in the future.

The save to .docx functionality is also quite interesting. As expected, it neatly left a "Wrestling Schedule.docx" file on my desktop with the correct data inside.

The hangman game was fun as well and seemed to work as expected.

Overall, great job. I can tell you guys put a lot of effort into this and enjoyed all the little touches.
